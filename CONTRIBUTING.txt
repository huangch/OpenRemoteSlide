===============================

huangch, Jan 2019

Â * Before you start, please read CONTRIBUTION-OpenSlide.txt 

 * Following the original instructions of OpenSlide showing in the 
   CONTRIBUTION-OpenSlide.txt, however, the compatibility with Windows
   wasn't able to be acomplished due to the differents in the libcurl
   packages. It might be possible to implement a version foer Windows,
   but it is not currently in my shooting range.

 * Ya, have fun! Graphics are a joy.
